            <h1>Motivation</h1>
            
            <div class="text-content">
                <p>Our understanding of how fundamental stellar properties, such as magnetic fields, rotation, chemical abundances, and asteroseismic behavior, evolve over time remains incomplete. A major challenge lies in the difficulty of determining precise stellar ages. Open clusters provide an exceptional laboratory for addressing this problem: their well-constrained ages, distances, and metallicities enable systematic studies of their member stars, making them pivotal environments for calibrating the relationships among stellar parameters and their evolution.</p>

                <p>Tracing these parameters across clusters of different ages reveals the underlying physics of angular momentum loss, internal mixing, magnetic dynamo action, and chemical abundances (e.g., Li I 6708Å, [C/N], [Y/Mg]), all of which are expected to change as stars evolve. Such insights are essential not only for stellar astrophysics but also for understanding how galactic chemical evolution affects abundance patterns over time, as well as how stellar parameters shape the evolution of planetary systems.</p>

                <h2>Session Goals and Description</h2>
                <p>In recent years, significant efforts have been made to empirically link stellar rotation, magnetic activity, and lithium depletion with age using open cluster populations. These relations form the foundation for calibrating stellar age-dating techniques, as open clusters serve as critical benchmarks for determining stellar ages and thereby advancing our understanding of the evolution of cool stars, planetary systems, and the Milky Way.</p>

                <p>This splinter session will focus on bringing together researchers studying different stellar properties in open clusters to explore the following key themes:</p>

                <h2>1. Rotational Evolution</h2>
                <div class="science-box">
                    <img src="images/rotation_evolution.png" alt="Rotation Period Evolution" class="science-figure">
                    <p><em>Figure 1: Rotation period data for benchmark open cluster populations across a wide age range, from ~120 Myr to ~2.7 Gyr. Figure from Curtis et al. (2020, ApJ 904, 140).</em></p>
                </div>
                <p>Stars in the main-sequence phase lose their angular momentum over time, leading to spin-down, but the extent and timescale of this spin evolution remain poorly constrained. Recent gyrochronology models based on open cluster data suggest a mass- and age-dependent slowdown, with possible plateaus in rotation evolution at specific epochs. These findings challenge classical gyrochronology and highlight the need to incorporate additional physics, such as magnetic braking saturation and core-envelope decoupling, to achieve more precise age calibrations.</p>

                <h2>2. Stellar Magnetic Activity</h2>
                <p>Magnetic activity, powered by the stellar dynamo, manifests in photospheric, chromospheric, and coronal emissions, all of which evolve as stars spin down. The advent of high-resolution spectroscopic surveys (e.g., Gaia-ESO, GALAH, LAMOST) has enabled direct measurements of chromospheric activity in cluster stars across a wide range of masses and ages. These datasets open new opportunities to understand the evolution of stellar activity, which will provide critical constraints on dynamo models, age-dating, and exoplanetary environments.</p>

                <h2>3. Chemical Abundances</h2>
                <div class="science-box">
                    <img src="images/lithium_depletion.png" alt="Lithium Depletion" class="science-figure">
                    <p><em>Figure 2: Equivalent width of the Li I 6708Å line as a function of T<sub>eff</sub> and age for stars in open clusters from the Gaia-ESO Survey. Figure from Jeffries et al. (2023, MNRAS 523, 802).</em></p>
                </div>
                <p>Lithium, easily destroyed at relatively low temperatures, is a sensitive probe of stellar mixing and evolution. Recent large-scale surveys (e.g., Gaia-ESO) have revealed complex lithium-depletion patterns in young open clusters, highlighting the roles of rotation and magnetic activity in driving internal mixing.</p>
                
                <p>The [C/N] ratio is another important abundance indicator, particularly in red giant stars, where the first dredge-up brings CNO-cycle products to the surface; this process depends on stellar mass and age. The [Y/Mg] abundance also serves as a valuable age diagnostic: yttrium, an s-process element mainly produced in Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars, contrasts with magnesium, an α-element synthesized in massive stars and dispersed by supernovae. Consequently, older stars tend to show higher [Y/Mg] ratios than younger ones.</p>

                <h2>4. Asteroseismology</h2>
                <p>Asteroseismic analyses, enabled by Kepler and TESS (and, from 2027, PLATO), provide the most precise stellar ages for evolved stars. Recent studies of cluster members have demonstrated the power of seismic constraints in calibrating stellar ages and internal structures. The future scope of extending such analyses to cool main-sequence stars will bridge the gap between gyrochronology, activity, and chemical evolution studies.</p>

                <h2>Why Cool Stars 23?</h2>
                <p>The timing of this session is particularly opportune. Recent photometric data from TESS and ground-based facilities (e.g., NGTS), together with legacy observations from Kepler & K2, and complemented by recent and ongoing spectroscopic surveys such as Gaia-ESO, GALAH, and LAMOST, now encompass open clusters spanning ages from ≈1 Myr to ≈3 Gyr.</p>

                <p>In the coming year, the large-scale <strong>4MOST & WEAVE</strong> spectroscopic surveys will conduct extensive observations of both open clusters and field stars, delivering high-resolution spectra for tens of thousands of cluster members. Combined with the forthcoming <strong>Gaia DR4</strong> precise astrometry and photometry, these data will constrain membership probabilities with exquisite precision.</p>

                <p>The synergy among these datasets, together with the application of advanced statistical and machine-learning methods, will produce an exceptionally detailed picture of stellar properties and their evolution, as traced by open clusters. Organizing this splinter session at this juncture is therefore particularly timely, providing a forum for researchers working across these complementary datasets to connect, exchange ideas, and foster collaborations.</p>

                <p>This topic directly aligns with the goals of Cool Stars 23, complementing the morning plenary sessions by providing a focused, integrative discussion on how stellar rotation, magnetic activity, and chemical evolution interconnect through the cluster sequence.</p>
